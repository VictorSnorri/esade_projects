## üîç Project: Predicting Loan Default with Machine Learning

**Files:**
- `AI2_victor_jansen_final.pdf`: Project summary slides
- `ai2_VictorJansen_final.ipynb`: Full Jupyter notebook

**Overview:**
This project focuses on predicting loan default risk using machine learning. It includes:
- Feature selection and engineering
- Correlation analysis and data preparation
- SMOTE balancing, model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Threshold tuning for optimal risk-return tradeoff

**Key Insight:**  
Even if accuracy isn't higher than baseline, the model still helps reduce financial risk by flagging high-risk loans.
